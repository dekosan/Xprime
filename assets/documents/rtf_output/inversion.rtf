{\par \b Syntax:}\par inversion(Point1, Realk, Point2)\par
{\par \b Description:}\par Draws the inversion of a point, with respect to another point, by a scale factor.\par
{\par \b Example:}\par inversion(GA, 3, GB) draws point C on line AB such that AB*AC=3. In this case, point A is the center of the inversion and the scale factor is 3. Point B is the point whose inversion is created.\par \par In general, the inversion of point A through center C, with scale factor k, maps A onto A\u8217?, such that A\u8217? is on line CA and CA*CA\u8217?=k, where CA and CA\u8217? denote the lengths of the corresponding segments. If k=1, then the lengths CA and CA\u8217? are reciprocals.\par }
