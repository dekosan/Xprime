{\par \b Syntax:}\par distanceatraw(Point1, Point2, Point3) or distanceatraw(Point1, Curve, Point3)\par
{\par \b Description:}\par This command is used in Symbolic view. Similar to distanceat(), this commmand returns the distance between two points or between a point and a curve and places that measurement at the location of Point3 in the Plot view. The distance is unlabeled.\par
{\par \b Example:}\par distanceatraw(1+I, 3+3i, point(0,0)) returns 2.828\u8230?or 2\u8730?2 and places that measure at the origin in Plot view.\par \par If GA is the point at (0, 0) and GB is defined as plotfunc(4-x^2/4), then distanceat(GA, GB, GA) returns 3.464\u8230? or 2\u8730?3 and places this measure in Plot view at (0,0).\par \par Define A:=point(0) and B:=point(1+i); then distanceatraw(A,B,(1+i)/2)) returns  \u8730?2 and places this measurement at (1/2, 1/2)\par }
