{\par \b Example:}\par perpendicular(GA, GD) draws a line perpendicular to line D through point A.\par perpendicular(3+2i, GB, GC) draws a line through the point whose coordinates are (3, 2) that is perpendicular to line BC.\par perpendicular(3+2i,line(x-y=1)) draws a line through the point whose coordinates are (3, 2) that is perpendicular to the line whose equation is x \u8211? y = 1; that is, the line whose equation is y=-x+5.\par }
