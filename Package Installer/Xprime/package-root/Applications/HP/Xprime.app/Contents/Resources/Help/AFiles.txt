Syntax:
AFiles(["name"]) returns the list of all these files.

Each HP Prime app can have any number of files associated with it. These files are sent with the app. For
example, if there is a file named icon.png associated with the app, then this file is used for the app icon in the
Application Library.

Example:
AFiles("name") returns the list of all these files.
AFiles("name") returns the contents of the file with the given name.
AFiles("name") := object stores the object in the file with the given name.
