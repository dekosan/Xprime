Syntax:
(&#39;display&#39;)=[color]

For example, suppose you have drawn a circle in the Geometry app. In Symbolic view, the circle&#39;s definition might be GC:=circle(GA,GB-GA). If you wanted that circle to be, say, red, you could modify that definition to read:

Example:
GC:=circle(GA,GB-GA, (&#39;display&#39;)=red)
