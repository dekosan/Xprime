Syntax:
orthocenter(Triangle) or orthocenter(Point1, Point2, Point3)

Returns the orthocenter of a triangle; that is, the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle. The argument can be either the name of a triangle or three non-collinear points that define a triangle. In the latter case, the triangle does not need to be drawn.

Example:
orthocenter(0,4i,4) returns (0,0)
