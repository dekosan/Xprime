Syntax:
perimeter(Polygon) or perimeter(Circle)

Returns the perimeter of a polygon or the circumference of a circle.

Example:
perimeter(0,1,i) returns √2+2
If GA is the point at (0, 0), GB is the point at (1, 0), and GC is defined as circle(GA, GB-GA), then perimeter(GC) returns 2π.
If GA is the point at (0, 0), GB is the point at (1, 0), and GC is defined as square(GA, GB-GA), then perimeter(GC) returns 4.
