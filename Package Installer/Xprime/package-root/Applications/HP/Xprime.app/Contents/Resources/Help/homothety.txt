Syntax:
homothety(Point, Realk, Object)

Dilates a geometric object, with respect to a center point, by a scale factor.

Example:
homothety(GA, 2, GB) creates a dilation centered at point A that has a scale factor of 2. Each point P on geometric object B has its image P’ on ray AP such that AP’=2AP.

homothety(point(0,0),1/3,point(9,9)) creates an image point at (3,3)
