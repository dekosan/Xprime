Syntax:
WAIT(n)

Halts program execution for the specified number of seconds.
If n is omitted or 0, halts execution until the user presses a key and returns the keycode (or -1 after 1 minute).

If n is -1, halts executions until the user presses a key or there is a mouse event.
If a key is pressed, the keycode is returned.
After a 1 minute timeout, returns -1

If a mouse event happends, a list of the form { type, [x, y], [dx, dy] } is returned. Normally x/y is the event position unless otherwise indicated.
Type can be:
0: Mouse Down
1: Mouse Move
2: Mouse Up (x/y is not provided)
3: Mouse Click (note, if a click is detected, there is no MouseUp)
5: Mouse Stretch. x/y is the delta since the last event. dx/dy is the delta since the ORIGINAL mouse down...
6: Mouse Rotate, x is original angle, y is new angle in 32nd of a circle.
7: Mouse Long Click, This means that the mouse stayed down for 1 second...

Example:
WAIT(5) halts program execution for 5 seconds.
