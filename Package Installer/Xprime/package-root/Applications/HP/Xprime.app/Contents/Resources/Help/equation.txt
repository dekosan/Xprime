Syntax:
equation(curve) or equation(point)

Returns the Cartesian equation of a curve in x and y, or the Cartesian coordinates of a point.

Example:
equation(line(1-i,i)) returns y=-2*x+1
If GA is the point at (0, 0), GB is the point at (1, 0), and GC is defined as circle(GA, GB-GA), then equation(GC) returns  x^2 + y^2 =1.
