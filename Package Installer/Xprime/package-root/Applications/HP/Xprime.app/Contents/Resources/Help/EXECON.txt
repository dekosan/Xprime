Syntax:
EXECON("expression with &amp;", lists or matrices)

Returns a matrix or list composed of the result of the evaluation of the expression after replacement of &amp; by each item in the input.

Example:
EXECON("&amp;1+1", {1,2,3}) returns {2,3,4}

If EXECON has only 1 list or matrix input, using &amp; followed by a number A (between 1 and 9) will replace &amp;A by the element i+A-1 of the input.
Example: EXECON("&amp;2-&amp;1", { 1, 4, 3, 5}") returns {3, -1, 2} - the difference between 2 successive elements.

If EXECON has 2 or more lists or matrices input, using &amp; followed by a number A (between 1 and 9) will replace &amp;1 by the element from the Ath input.
Example: EXECON("&amp;1+&amp;2", {1,2,3},{4,5,6}) returns {5,7,9}

If EXECON has 2 or more lists or matrices as input, using &amp; followed by 2 numbers A and B (between 1 and 9) will reaplace &amp;AB by the element i+B-1 of the Ath input.
Example: EXECON("&amp;22-&amp;1", {1,2,3},{4,5,6,7}) returns {4,4,4}

Note that for matrix input, the elements are treated as if the matrix was a vector.
