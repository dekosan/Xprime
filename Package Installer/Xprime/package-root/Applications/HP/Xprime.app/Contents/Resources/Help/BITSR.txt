Syntax:
BITSR(int1[, int2])

Bitwise shift right. Takes one or two integers as input and returns the result of shifting the bits in the first integer to the right by the number of places indicated by the second integer. If there is no second integer, then the bits in the first integer are shifted to the right one place.

Example:
BITSR(112, 2) returns 28
BITSR(10) returns 5
