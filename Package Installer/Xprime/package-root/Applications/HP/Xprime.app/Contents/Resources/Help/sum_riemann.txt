Syntax:
sum_riemann(Expr,List(Var1,Var2))

Returns, in the neighbourhood of n=∞, an equivalent of the sum of Expr(Var1,Var2) for Var2 from Var2=1 to Var2=Var1 when the sum is looked at as a Riemann sum associated with a continuous function defined on [0,1]

Example:
sum_riemann(1/(n+k),[n,k]) returns ln(2)
