Syntax:
altitude(point1, point2, point3)

Given three non-collinear points, draws the altitude of the triangle defined by the three points that passes through the first point. The triangle does not have to be drawn.

Example:
altitude(A, B, C) draws a line passing through point A that is perpendicular to BC.
