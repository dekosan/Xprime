Syntax:
point(Real1, Real2) or point(Expr1, Expr2) or point(Complex)

Creates a point, given the coordinates of the point. Each coordinate may be a value or an expression involving variables or measurements on other objects in the geometric construction.

Example:
point(3,4) creates a point whose coordinates are (3,4). This point may be selected and moved later.
point(abscissa(GA), ordinate(GB)) creates a point whose x-coordinate is the same as that of a point A and whose y-coordinate is the same as that of a point B. This point will change to reflect the movements of point A or point B.
