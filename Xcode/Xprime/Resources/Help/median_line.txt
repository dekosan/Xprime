Syntax:
median_line(Point1, Point2, Point3)

Given three points that define a triangle, creates the median of the triangle that passes through the first point and contains the midpoint of the segment defined by the other two points.

Example:
median_line(0, 8i, 4) draws the line whose equation is y=2x; that is, the line through (0,0) and (2,4), the midpoint of the segment whose endpoints are (0, 8) and (4, 0).
