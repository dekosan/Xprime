{\par \b Syntax:}\par PRINT(expr) or PRINT(string) or PRINT( )\par
{\par \b Description:}\par Prints either the result of expr or string to the terminal.\par \par The terminal is a program text output viewing mechanism which is displayed only when PRINT commands are executed. When visible, you can use the up/down keys to view the text, BKSP to erase the text and any other key to hide the terminal. You can show the terminal at anytime using the ON+T combination (press and HOLD the ON key, then press the T key, then release both keys). Pressing ON stops the interaction with the terminal.\par \par PRINT with no argument clears the terminal.\par
