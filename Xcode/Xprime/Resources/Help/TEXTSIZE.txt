Syntax:
TEXTSIZE(text, [font])

Returns the pixel dimensions of text when rendered using the specified font. No text is drawn.

TEXTSIZE is typically used to determine the width and height of a string before drawing it, making it useful for centering or aligning text on the screen.

The function returns a 2-element list {width, height}, where:
• width is the number of pixels the text would occupy horizontally
• height is the number of pixels the text would occupy vertically

Example:
TEXTSIZE("Some text", 3) returns {65, 16}

In this example, the text would be 65 pixels wide and 16 pixels high if drawn using font 3. No graphics are modified by this command.

If font is omitted, the current font is used.
