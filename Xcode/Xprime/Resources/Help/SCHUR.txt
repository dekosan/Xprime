Syntax:
SCHUR(matrix)

Schur Decomposition. Factors a square matrix into two matrices. If matrix is real, then the result is {[[orthogonal]],[[upper-quasi triangular]]}.
If Complex mode is on and the matrix is complex, then the result is 
{[[unitary]],[[upper-triangular]]}.

Example:
SCHUR([[1,2],[3,4]])
