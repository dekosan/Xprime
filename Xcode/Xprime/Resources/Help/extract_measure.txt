Syntax:
extract_measure(Var)

Returns the definition of a geometric object. For a point, that definition consists of the coordinates of the point. For other objects, the definition mirrors their definition in Symbolic view, with the coordinates of their defining points supplied.

Example:
extract_measure(angleatraw(0,1,1+i,1)
extract_measure(distanceatraw(0,1+i,(1+i)/2)) returns √2
