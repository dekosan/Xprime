{\par \b Syntax:}\par QUOTE(expression)\par
{\par \b Description:}\par Returns the expression unchanged and un-evaluated.\par This function is mostly used with the STO\u9654? command in order to store a function in a function variable. For example if you want to store SIN(X) in F1.you cannot do SIN(X)\u9658?F1 as SIN(X) would be evaluated and a numerical result would be stored into F1. QUOTE(SIN(X))\u9658?F1 will store SIN(X) in F1.\par
