Syntax:
right_triangle(Point1, Point2, Realk)

Draws a right triangle given two points and a scale factor. One leg of the right triangle is defined by the two points, the vertex of the right angle is at the first point, and the scale factor multiplies the length of the first leg to determine the length of the second leg.

Example:
right_triangle(GA, GB, 1) draws an isosceles right triangles with its right angle at point A, and with both legs equal in length to segment AB.
