Syntax:
exbisector(Point1, Point2, Point3)

Given three points that define a triangle, creates the bisector of the exterior angles of the triangle whose common vertex is at the first point. The triangle does not have to be drawn in the Plot view.

Example:
exbisector(GA, GB, GC) draws the bisector of the exterior angles of ΔABC whose common vertex is at point A.

exbisector(0,–4i,4) draws the line given by y=x
