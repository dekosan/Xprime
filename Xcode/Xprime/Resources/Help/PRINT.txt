Syntax:
PRINT(expr) or PRINT(string) or PRINT( )

Prints either the result of expr or string to the terminal.

The terminal is a program text output viewing mechanism which is displayed only when PRINT commands are executed. When visible, you can use the up/down keys to view the text, BKSP to erase the text and any other key to hide the terminal. You can show the terminal at anytime using the ON+T combination (press and HOLD the ON key, then press the T key, then release both keys). Pressing ON stops the interaction with the terminal.

PRINT with no argument clears the terminal.
