{\par \b Syntax:}\par homothety(Point, Realk, Object)\par
{\par \b Description:}\par Dilates a geometric object, with respect to a center point, by a scale factor.\par
{\par \b Example:}\par homothety(GA, 2, GB) creates a dilation centered at point A that has a scale factor of 2. Each point P on geometric object B has its image P\u8217? on ray AP such that AP\u8217?=2AP.\par \par homothety(point(0,0),1/3,point(9,9)) creates an image point at (3,3)\par }
