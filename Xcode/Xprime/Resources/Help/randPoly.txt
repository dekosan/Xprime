Syntax:
randpoly([Var],Intgr,[Dist])

Returns a vector of coefficients of a polynomial of variable Var (or x), of degree Intgr and where the coefficients are random integers in the range -99 through 99 with uniform distribution or in an interval specified by Intrvl.

Example:
randpoly(t, 8, -1..1) returns a vector of 9 random integers, all of them between -1 and 1.
