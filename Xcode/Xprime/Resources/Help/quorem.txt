Syntax:
quorem(Poly1, Poly2) or quorem(Vector1, Vector2)

Returns the Euclidean quotient and remainder of the quotient of 2 polynomials in a vector. If the polynomials are expressed as vectors of their coefficients, then this command returns a similar vector of the quotient and a vector of the remainder.

Example:
quorem(x^3+2*x^2+3*x+4,-x+2) returns [-x^2-4*x-11, 26]
quorem([1,2,3,4],[-1,2]) returns [[-1, -4, -11] [26]]
