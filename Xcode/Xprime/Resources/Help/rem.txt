Syntax:
rem(Poly1, Poly2) or rem(Vector1, Vector2)

Returns the Euclidean remainder of the quotient of 2 polynomials.  If the polynomials are expressed as vectors of their coefficients, then this command returns a similar vector of the remainder.

Example:
rem(x^3+2*x^2+3*x+4,-x+2) returns 26
rem([1,2,3,4],[-1,2]) returns [26]
