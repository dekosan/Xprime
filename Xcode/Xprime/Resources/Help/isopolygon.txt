Syntax:
isopolygon(Point1, Point2, Realn), where realn is an integer greater than 1.

Draws a regular polygon given the first two vertices and the number of sides, where the number of sides is greater than 1. If the number of sides is 2, then the segment is drawn. You can provide CAS variable names for storing the coordinates of the calculated points in the order they were created. The orientation of the polygon is counterclockwise.

Example:
isopolygon(GA, GB, 6) draws a regular hexagon whose first two vertices are the points A and B.
